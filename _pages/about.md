# About Me
I'm currently a senior student at School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, major in Intelligence Science and Technology.  
I've been at Nanyang Technological University as a visiting scholar in Summer 2019, coorperating with [Dr. Sheng Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/shengwangcs/), New York University, under the supervision of [Prof. Gao Cong](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/gaocong/). And also benefit a lot from [Dr. Xiucheng Li](https://xiucheng.org), Nanyang Technological University.    
I'm teaching assistant of [Prof. Xiaoming Li](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~lxm/), Peking University, for the course "Networks, Crowds and. Markets".   
My interests include data mining, database and information retrieval. And under the influence from [Prof. Xiaoming Li](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~lxm/) at Peking University, I've been following new progress that combines economics, sociology and computer science together.
