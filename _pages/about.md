I'm currently a senior student at Peking University, major in Intelligence Science and Technology.  
This summer, I've been at Nanyang Technological University as a visiting scholar, coorperating with [https://sites.google.com/site/shengwangcs/](Dr. Sheng Wang), Ner York University, under the supervision of [https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/gaocong/](Prof. Gao Cong).  
My interests include data mining, database and information retrieval. And under the influence from [http://net.pku.edu.cn/~lxm/](Prof. Xiaoming Li), I've been following progress that combines economics, sociology and computer science.
