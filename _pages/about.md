I'm currently a senior student at Peking University, major in Intelligence Science and Technology.  
This summer, I've been at Nanyang Technological University as a visiting scholar, coorperating with [Dr. Sheng Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/shengwangcs/), New York University, under the supervision of [Prof. Gao Cong](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/gaocong/).  
My interests include data mining, database and information retrieval. And under the influence from [Prof. Xiaoming Li](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~lxm/), I've been following new progress that combines economics, sociology and computer science together.
